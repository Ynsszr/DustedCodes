# About

Inspired by GitHub Pages and Jekyll this is an F# blog engine which renders static HTML pages.

Blog articles can be written in Markdown or HTML. Markdown pages get compiled into static HTML pages once at runtime.

Feel free to fork it and create your own nerdy space in the world wide web!

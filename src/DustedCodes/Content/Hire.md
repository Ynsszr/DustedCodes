### Software Development

I can build a huge variety of web-based software. Having over a decade of product development experience, I can help you build anything from an e-commerce website to a highly scalable backend system. I have extensive knowledge and hands-on experience with all three major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and many of the latest cutting edge technologies (...). One of my defining qualities is that I'm extremely delivery focused, striking the right balance between building a feature rich product, meeting important timelines and also keeping complexity to a minimum. As a result I can help you to maximise value and minimize cost, thus ensuring a good return on investment.

### Software Architecture

Over the years I've had the pleasure of working with some of the most talented software architects together as well as leading the architecture of entire applications myself. Good software architecture is not only about making the right technological choices, but also about understanding the intricate requirements of a business, the unique needs of a software development team and the expectations of a customer. By taking all these factors into account I can help a team making smart choices and implementing an application architecture which can drive success.

### DevOps

The most successful product teams are those which have the means of getting their work easily tested, integrated and delivered to their customers in a highly reliable and low effort fashion. Whether you need help with building robust automation tests, getting a fully managed CI/CD pipeline in place or setting up your development and production environment in a secure and scalable manner I can assist you with all these tasks. Additionally I can also help with the implementation of system monitoring and logging frameworks which are an essential part of keeping your applications healthy.

# About

Hi, welcome to my personal website, software engineering blog and dumping ground for the occasional brain fart. I'm Dustin, a software developer, entrepreneur and open source contributor who's originally from Vienna, Austria and currently living in the UK.

Over the [course of my career](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dustinmoris/) I've had the pleasure of working with a wealth of different technologies for various sized companies, mainly operating in very agile teams following [Scrum or Kanban](https://dusted.codes/when-to-use-scrum-waterfall-vs-scrum-vs-kanban-vs-scrumban), using continuous deployment and most major clouds (AWS, Google and Azure) to deliver mission critical software. I was also lucky enough to lead and manage a team of highly skilled engineers building large scale Facebook games for one of Europe's largest gaming companies. After almost 10 years in the corporate world, numerous battle scars and a growing appetite for a new adventure I finally threw the towel in 2017, decided to [travel the world with my wife](https://www.instagram.com/dustedtravels/) for almost an entire year and eventually came back to the UK to set up my own business. Today I [maintain several open source projects](https://github.com/dustinmoris), contract on a side whilst also trying to set up my own start-up from the ground up.

If I'm not busy building something for the web then I'm probably doing sports (basketball, snowboarding, surfing, swimming), reading a book, watching stand-up comedy or travelling. I am also a huge foodie and coffee addict, which means that I spend a fair amount of my time [exploring new coffee shops and restaurants in London](https://top10.london) and around the world. However, besides all of these hobbies my absolute favourite downtime activity is a round of board games with friends and family.

## Dusted Codes

Dusted Codes is a blog which I've started in 2015 after finally convincing myself to put some of my thoughts and ideas into writing. On this blog I mostly write about web development topics with a strong focus on .NET Core, F# and C#, general programming trends, agile methodologies and software security practises.

This blog has also been built with [Giraffe](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe) (a functional ASP.NET Core web framework for F# developers) and is [open source and publicly hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/dustinmoris/DustedCodes), where you can [fork it](https://github.com/dustinmoris/DustedCodes/fork), [report a bug](https://github.com/dustinmoris/DustedCodes/issues/new) or [submit a contribution](https://github.com/dustinmoris/DustedCodes/pulls).
